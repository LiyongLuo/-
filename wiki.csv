"{'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder', 'summary': u"" A genetic disorder is a genetic problem caused by one or more abnormalities in the genome, especially a condition that is present from birth (congenital). Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions.Genetic disorders may be hereditary, passed down from the parents' genes. In other genetic disorders, defects may be caused by new mutations or changes to the DNA. In such cases, the defect will only be passed down if it occurs in the germ line. The same disease, such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and mainly by environmental causes in other people. Whether, when and to what extent a person with the genetic defect or abnormality will actually suffer from the disease is almost always affected by the environmental factors and events in the person's development.Some types of recessive gene disorders confer an advantage in certain environments when only one copy of the gene is present.[1]"", 'title': u'Genetic disorder'}","{'url': u'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome', 'summary': u' An autosome is a chromosome that is not an allosome (a sex chromosome).[1] The members of an autosome pair in a diploid cell have the same morphology unlike those in allosome pairs which may have different structure. The DNA in autosomes is collectively known as atDNA or auDNA.[2]For example, humans have a diploid genome that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one allosome pair (46 chromosomes total). The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1\u201322 in humans) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labelled with their letters.[3] By contrast, the allosome pair consists of two X chromosomes in females or one X and one Y chromosome in males. (Unusual combinations of XYY, XXY, XXX, XXXX, XXXXX or XXYY, among other allosome combinations, are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities.)Autosomes still contain sexual determination genes even though they are not sex chromosomes. For example, the SRY gene on the Y chromosome encodes the transcription factor TDF and is vital for male sex determination during development. TDF functions by activating the SOX9 gene on chromosome 17, so mutations of the SOX9 gene can cause humans with a Y chromosome to develop as females.[4]', 'title': u'Autosome'}","{'url': u'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-aggravated_myotonia', 'summary': u' Potassium-aggravated myotonia is a rare genetic disorder that affects skeletal muscle. Beginning in childhood or adolescence, people with this condition experience bouts of sustained muscle tensing (myotonia) that prevent muscles from relaxing normally. Myotonia causes muscle stiffness, often painful, that worsens after exercise and may be aggravated by eating potassium-rich foods such as bananas and potatoes. Stiffness occurs in skeletal muscles throughout the body. Potassium-aggravated myotonia ranges in severity from mild episodes of muscle stiffness to severe, disabling disease with frequent attacks. Potassium-aggravated myotonia may, in some cases, also cause paradoxical myotonia, in which myotonia becomes more severe at the time of movement instead of after movement has ceased. Unlike some other forms of myotonia, potassium-aggravated myotonia is not associated with episodes of muscle weakness.Mutations in the SCN4A gene cause potassium-aggravated myotonia. The SCN4A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for the normal function of skeletal muscle cells. For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles contract and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of positively charged ions, including sodium, into skeletal muscle cells. The SCN4A protein forms channels that control the flow of sodium ions into these cells. Mutations in the SCN4A gene alter the usual structure and function of sodium channels. The altered channels cannot properly regulate ion flow, increasing the movement of sodium ions into skeletal muscle cells. The influx of extra sodium ions triggers prolonged muscle contractions, which are the hallmark of myotonia.Potassium-aggravated myotonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits a mutation in the SCN4A gene from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.', 'title': u'Potassium-aggravated myotonia'}","{'url': u'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosis_hystrix', 'summary': u' Ichthyosis hystrix is a group of rare skin disorders in the ichthyosis family of skin disorders characterized by massive hyperkeratosis with an appearance like spiny scales.[1] This term is also used to refer to a type of epidermal nevi with extensive bilateral distribution.[1][2]', 'title': u'Ichthyosis hystrix'}","{'url': u'https://ml.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B4%AA%E0%B4%BE%E0%B4%B0%E0%B4%AE%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%AA%E0%B4%B0%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%AF%E0%B4%B0%E0%B5%8B%E0%B4%97%E0%B4%99%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%99%E0%B5%BE', 'summary': u' \u0d1c\u0d28\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d15 \u0d35\u0d48\u0d15\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d7e \u0d2e\u0d42\u0d32\u0d2e\u0d41\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d3e\u0d15\u0d41\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28 \u0d30\u0d4b\u0d17\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d33\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d \u0d1c\u0d28\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d15\u0d30\u0d4b\u0d17\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d7e \u0d05\u0d25\u0d35\u0d3e \u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d30\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d30\u0d4b\u0d17\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d7e. \u0d1a\u0d3f\u0d32 \u0d1c\u0d28\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d15\u0d30\u0d4b\u0d17\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d7e \u0d30\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d37\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d33\u0d3f\u0d7d \u0d28\u0d3f\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d41\u0d02 \u0d15\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d33\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d47\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4d \u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d30\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d2f\u0d3f \u0d2a\u0d15\u0d7c\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d41 \u0d15\u0d3f\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d35\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d. \u0d35\u0d47\u0d31\u0d46\u0d1a\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d35 \u0d2a\u0d41\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d2f \u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d42\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d47\u0d37\u0d7b \u0d35\u0d34\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d4b,DNA\u0d2f\u0d3f\u0d7d \u0d35\u0d30\u0d41\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28 \u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d31\u0d4d\u0d31\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d7e \u0d35\u0d34\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d4b \u0d38\u0d02\u0d2d\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d41\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d. \u0d08 \u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d42\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d47\u0d37\u0d28\u0d41\u0d15\u0d7e \u0d1a\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d4b\u0d7e \u0d05\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24 \u0d24\u0d32\u0d2e\u0d41\u0d31\u0d15\u0d33\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d47\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d41\u0d02 \u0d15\u0d48\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d31\u0d4d\u0d31\u0d02 \u0d1a\u0d46\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d47\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d02. \u0d09\u0d26\u0d3e\xa0:- \u0d39\u0d40\u0d2e\u0d4b\u0d2b\u0d40\u0d32\u0d3f\u0d2f \u0d2e\u0d41\u0d24\u0d32\u0d3e\u0d2f \u0d30\u0d4b\u0d17\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d7d.', 'title': u'\u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d30\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d30\u0d4b\u0d17\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d7e'}","{'url': u'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barraquer%E2%80%93Simons_syndrome', 'summary': u' Barraquer\u2013Simons syndrome (or acquired partial lipodystrophy,[1] cephalothoracic lipodystrophy,[1] and progressive lipodystrophy)[1]) is a rare form of lipodystrophy, which usually first affects the head, and then spreads to the thorax.[2][3]It is named for Luis Barraquer Roviralta (1855\u20131928), a Spanish physician, and Arthur Simons (1879\u20131942), a German physician.[4][5][6]Some evidence links it to LMNB2.[7]', 'title': u'Barraquer\u2013Simons syndrome'}","{'url': u'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminin', 'summary': u' Laminins are high-molecular weight (~400 to ~900 kDa) proteins of the extracellular matrix. They are a major component of the basal lamina (one of the layers of the basement membrane), a protein network foundation for most cells and organs. The laminins are an important and biologically active part of the basal lamina, influencing cell differentiation, migration, and adhesion.[1][2]Laminins are heterotrimeric proteins that contain an \u03b1-chain, a \u03b2-chain, and a \u03b3-chain, found in five, four, and three genetic variants, respectively. The laminin molecules are named according to their chain composition. Thus, laminin-511 contains \u03b15, \u03b21, and \u03b31 chains.[3] Fourteen other chain combinations have been identified in vivo. The trimeric proteins intersect to form a cross-like structure that can bind to other cell membrane and extracellular matrix molecules.[4] The three shorter arms are particularly good at binding to other laminin molecules, which allows them to form sheets. The long arm is capable of binding to cells, which helps anchor organized tissue cells to the membrane.The laminin family of glycoproteins are an integral part of the structural scaffolding in almost every tissue of an organism. They are secreted and incorporated into cell-associated extracellular matrices. Laminin is vital for the maintenance and survival of tissues.

Belief in an afterlife, which may be naturalistic or supernatural, is in contrast to the belief in oblivion after death.In some popular views, this continued existence often takes place in a spiritual realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be reborn into this world and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or Otherworld.

The term ""rapture"" has come especially to distinguish this event from the event of the ""Second Coming"" of Jesus Christ to Earth, as some think is predicted elsewhere in the Bible, in Second Thessalonians, Gospel of Matthew, First Corinthians and the Revelation.[3]The term ""rapture"" is especially useful in discussing or disputing the exact timing or the scope of the event, particularly when asserting the ""pre-tribulation"" view that the rapture will occur before, not during, the Second Coming, with or without an extended Tribulation period.[4] This is now the most common use of the term, especially among Christian theologians and fundamentalist Christians in the United States.[5] Other, older uses of ""rapture"" were simply as a term for any mystical union with God or for eternal life in Heaven with God.[6] Catholics believe that the ""Rapture"" as a gathering with Christ in Heaven will take place, though they do not generally use the word ""Rapture"" to refer to this event, sometime during the second coming of Christ.[7]There are many views among Christians regarding the timing of Christ\'s return (including whether it will occur in one event or two), and various views regarding the destination of the aerial gathering described in 1 Thessalonians 4.

This includes protein-coding genes as well as RNA genes, but may also include prediction of other functional elements such as regulatory regions. Gene finding is one of the first and most important steps in understanding the genome of a species once it has been sequenced.In its earliest days, ""gene finding"" was based on painstaking experimentation on living cells and organisms. Statistical analysis of the rates of homologous recombination of several different genes could determine their order on a certain chromosome, and information from many such experiments could be combined to create a genetic map specifying the rough location of known genes relative to each other. Today, with comprehensive genome sequence and powerful computational resources at the disposal of the research community, gene finding has been redefined as a largely computational problem.Determining that a sequence is functional should be distinguished from determining the function of the gene or its product. Predicting the function of a gene and confirming that the gene prediction is accurate still demands in vivo experimentation[1] through gene knockout and other assays, although frontiers of bioinformatics research[citation needed] are making it increasingly possible to predict the function of a gene based on its sequence alone.', 'title': u'Gene prediction'}","{'url': u'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)', 'summary': u' New ideas and proposals are discussed here.

Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the best of all possible worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.Second-century philosopher and theologian Irenaeus, after whom the theodicy is named, proposed a two-stage creation process in which humans require free will and the experience of evil to develop. Another early Christian theologian, Origen, presented a response to the problem of evil which cast the world as a schoolroom or hospital for the soul; theologian Mark Scott has argued that Origen, rather than Irenaeus, ought to be considered the father of this kind of theodicy. Friedrich Schleiermacher argued in the nineteenth century that God must necessarily create flawlessly, so this world must be the best possible world because it allows God\'s purposes to be naturally fulfilled. In 1966, philosopher John Hick discussed the similarities of the preceding theodicies, calling them all ""Irenaean"". He supported the view that creation is incomplete and argued that the world is best placed for the full moral development of humans, as it presents genuine moral choices. British philosopher Richard Swinburne proposed that, to make a free moral choice, humans must have experience of the consequences of their own actions and that natural evil must exist to provide such choices.The development of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God\'s power is limited and that he cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported the idea that this world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God\'s infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God\'s sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick\'s universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.', 'title': u'Irenaean theodicy'}","{'url': u'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidrat_al-Muntaha', 'summary': u"" Sidrat al-Muntah\u0101 (Arabic: \u0633\u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062a\u0647\u0649\u200e\u200e) is a Lote tree[1] that marks the end of the seventh heaven, the boundary where no creation can pass, according to Islamic beliefs.

He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of Akka in the Ottoman province of Syria, in what is now Israel. Following Bah\xe1'u'll\xe1h's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son `Abdu'l-Bah\xe1 (1844-1921), and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957). Bah\xe1'\xeds around the world annually elect local, regional, and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bah\xe1'\xed community, which sits in Haifa, Israel near the shrine of B\xe1b.Bah\xe1'\xed teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths: God is considered single and all-powerful. However, Bah\xe1'u'll\xe1h taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the B\xe1b and Bah\xe1'u'll\xe1h. As such, Bah\xe1'\xeds regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism. At the heart of Bah\xe1'\xed teachings is the goal of a unified world order that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.[6][7]"", 'title': u""Bah\xe1'\xed Faith""}","{'url': u'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus', 'summary': u' Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small (55\u201365 nm in size), enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae.

It is distinguished from genetic variability, which describes the tendency of genetic characteristics to vary.Genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. The population will continue for more generations because of the success of these individuals.[1]The academic field of population genetics includes several hypotheses and theories regarding genetic diversity. The neutral theory of evolution proposes that diversity is the result of the accumulation of neutral substitutions. Diversifying selection is the hypothesis that two subpopulations of a species live in different environments that select for different alleles at a particular locus. This may occur, for instance, if a species has a large range relative to the mobility of individuals within it. Frequency-dependent selection is the hypothesis that as alleles become more common, they become more vulnerable. This occurs in host\u2013pathogen interactions, where a high frequency of a defensive allele among the host means that it is more likely that a pathogen will spread if it is able to overcome that allele.', 'title': u'Genetic diversity'}","{'url': u'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Directory', 'summary': u"" This is a descriptive directory of Wikipedia's how-to and information pages, alongside other related administrative pages in the Wikipedia and Help namespaces.
